## 2. ðŸ“ˆ Seasonally Adjusted Sales Forecast (1992â€“2011)

**Description:**  
A time series forecasting project using exponential regression to model and predict seasonally adjusted sales over a span of nearly three decades.

**Key Features:**
- Forecasts future sales using an exponential growth model:  
  `y = 158193 * e^(0.043x)`
- Calculation of annual percent growth
- Model accuracy evaluated using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Visualized trendline with projection for 1992â€“2011

**Tools Used:**  
Microsoft Excel (curve fitting, charting, error analysis)

## 3. ðŸ§® Project Portfolio Optimization (with Budget & ROI Constraints)

**Description:**  
Implements a binary decision model to select investment projects across functional areas, subject to multiple budget and performance constraints.

**Key Features:**
- Binary variables (0/1) for project approval
- Capital expenditure limits per year and over 3 years
- ROI thresholds and scenario-based NPV adjustment
- Automatic updates and impact analysis using data tables
- Visualizations for total capital use and allocation across functions

**Tools Used:**  
Microsoft Excel (Solver, data tables, charting, constraint logic)
